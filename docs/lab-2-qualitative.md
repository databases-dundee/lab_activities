# Lab 2 - Heuristic Evaluation/Qualitative Methods

This lab is a good time to work on your Heuristic Evaluation assignment with your group (see [last week's instructions](https://databases-dundee.github.io/lab_activities/#/lab-1-heuristics.md) for the steps this involves).

**Alternatively**, if you have made good progress with your evaluation (or your other group members haven't showed up) this is a good time to practise real-world observation.

## What you need to do
If you're not working on the Heuristic Evaluation, get out of here and start observing! People around you are using technology in so many different ways - working at a desktop/laptop computer, calling/scrolling on a smartphone, using an ATM, scanning a card, listening to music, making coffee, toasting toast, looking at the bus/train timetable, driving a car/e-scooter, watching Netflix, even using a defibrillator (ideally rarely). Everyone uses technology, whether they are conscious of it or not, in different ways, for different tasks, and in different environments.
Get out of the lab for an hour, and conduct a non-participant observation (where you're not actively involved) in one (or various settings). This could be the library, the campus green, the campus in general, a shop, the city centre, a café, Perth Road, or any location you like really. 
During, or immediately after, make notes on what you observe about people's technology use.
Think about:
 - What are the interesting issues / main themes that you have detected?
 - How do people behave when using their particular technology?
 - Do you think your presence affected what was happening?
 - What was your observational method?
 - What was your understanding of what was happening?
 - About what, if anything, did you wish you could know more detail?
 - Are there any ethical issues you have considered?

## From Observation to Interviews
Based on your observation, design an interview that you might use to understand more about 
how and why people use technology. What sort of questions would you ask and why? How 
much structure would you want to have? Would you use any props or observations? 

Once you have this interview designed, try it on a classmate, friend, or both!
Think about:
 - What did this teach you about interviewing? 
 - Were there questions that you should have asked but didn’t? 
 - What worked well, what didn’t?
 - How did you record / analyse the interview?
 - Any ethical issues you have considered?
Be prepared to compare the two techniques and report back in class and in tutorial
