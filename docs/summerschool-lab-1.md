# Lab 1 - Getting started with HTML

This lab is to give you practice in understanding what HTML elements to use to structure the content of an example website. As we talked about earlier, your web browser doesn't know what to do with text that isn't wrapped in the right elements!

## What you need to do

First, <a href="https://codepen.io/Dan_Rough/pen/QwbopZy" target="_blank">open this CodePen link</a>.

On the left, in the 'HTML' window, you'll see some text I've written for a blog website with a post. On the right, you can see what this would look like in a web browser - it's a bit of a mess! All the text is clumped together and really doesn't have any structure.

I'd like you to use the HTML elements I just talked about to give this some correct structure. 

### Headings
Headings can go from h1 to h6, and are mostly used for introducing new sections of text.
For example, website titles should usually be in an h1 element, big sections of the site in h2 elements, and any subsections in h3 elements, and so on.

Here's a <a href="https://codepen.io/Dan_Rough/pen/qBQMKeV" target="_blank">link to show how to use headings</a>.

### Paragraphs
Text that could be considered 'content' (rather than a heading) should usually be in paragraph elements. Because the browser ignores any spaces in your HTML document, putting text in paragraph elements will give it the correct structure.

Here's a <a href="https://codepen.io/Dan_Rough/pen/dPoreOJ" target="_blank">link to a couple of example paragraphs</a>.

### Lists
Remember that lists can be ordered (with numbers) or unordered (with bullet points).

Here's a <a href="https://codepen.io/Dan_Rough/pen/YPXBBjy" target="_blank">link to my lists example</a>.

### Quotes
To include quotes in a document, the 'blockquote' element is used, along with the 'cite' element to indicate who wrote it and where it was written.

## Anything to submit?
There's no mandatory submission here, but I'll be going around the lab and checking in on everyone. If you would like some feedback that I didn't give during the lab, please email me at drough001@dundee.ac.uk!

## Anything else?
If you're done with that and want some more practice (it's all helpful for your first assignment!), try the following:
